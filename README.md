## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a full-stack developer building modern web applications using Node.js for the backend and React for the frontend. This project showcases a complete end-to-end architecture that emphasizes clean API integration, efficient state management, and a modular, component-driven user interface.

On the backend, I use Node.js with frameworks like Express to create scalable, RESTful APIs that power dynamic web experiences. These APIs handle everything from authentication and database interactions to business logic and third-party integrations. The codebase is structured to separate concerns cleanlyâ€”using middleware, services, and controllersâ€”to ensure maintainability and testability across the application.

The frontend is built with React, where each UI element is designed as a reusable component. I follow a component-driven development approach using modern hooks and functional components, allowing for clean, declarative UI logic. The application is organized for scalability, with clear boundaries between presentational and container components, and styled using tools like CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS, or Styled Components.

State management is handled thoughtfully using tools like Redux, Context API, or Zustand depending on the scope of the application. This ensures a predictable and centralized state flow, especially when dealing with API data, user sessions, and dynamic UI behavior. Axios or Fetch is used for handling API requests, with loading and error states built into the user experience.

This repository provides a full-stack blueprint for anyone looking to understand how modern web apps are structured, integrated, and optimized. Whether youâ€™re building your first full-stack project or refining your architecture, this codebase offers practical patterns and a solid foundation for scalable web development.
